### ğŸ‘‹ Hello there 

#### I'm Ruben. Here you can take a look into my recent Projects.

- ğŸŒ± I'm interested in Visual Computing, Data Science and a lot more
- ğŸ“– I recently completed my second Bachelor's degree. In computer science.
- ğŸ‘€ My first degree was in educational science. After that, I worked as a social worker for 5 years. And I think that goes well together with IT.
  
- statistics here might be a bit of as I have moved the projects from different places here.
